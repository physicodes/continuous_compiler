#+TITLE: Continuous Compiler

* Background

Initial problem was that I wanted to compile on save in WSL
while using any editor in Windows so all I need to do to see
the updated pdf is reload the pdf viewer.

So it doesn't miss saves which closely follow each other, I
have used an asyncronous method of running the compiler in a
subprocess. If one save closely follows another then the
previous process is cancelled and the compiler called again.

* Future Development

Would be better to queue, updated saves and started compiles
because it needs to compile twice after it is cancelled
anyway.

Could also generalise it to take different stuff through
command line arguments, potentially setting defaults through
config files.
